Well somebody told me that you had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential, I've got potential
Rushing and rushing around
Ready let's roll onto something new
Takin' it's toll then I'm leaving without you
'Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this
I said heaven ain't close in a place like this
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight
Somebody told me that you had a boyfriend
Who looked like a girlfriend
That I had in February of last year
It's not confidential, I've got potential
A rushing, rushing around
